I am a Postdoc student of [The Faculty of Industrial Engineering and Management at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/programs/undergraduate/industrial-engineering-and-management/about.html) hosted by [Prof. Leonid Mytnik](https://web.iem.technion.ac.il/en/people/userprofile/leonidm.html). Before, I got my Ph.D. at the [School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Yan-Xia Ren](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/renyx/indexE.htm). I also visited [Prof. Renming Song](https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~rsong/) as a joint Ph.D. student at [Mathematics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://math.illinois.edu/). I got my B.S. at the [School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University.](http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/en) My research interest is probability theory, with a focus on models related to population dynamics.
